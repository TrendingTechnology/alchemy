# Quickstart

Projects for getting up and running in Alchemy. Contains lots of example code & ways to share code between iOS and an Alchemy server.

## Installation

Using the CLI, type `alchemy new <project-name>`. You'll be offered a few options:

### Server only

A package that's just an Alchemy server.

### Server + Shared Package

Two packages, one is an Alchemy server & another is a package for sharing code between the server & an existing project. Useful for integrating into existing iOS projects.

### Server + Shared + iOS App

An Alchemy server, iOS app, and shared package, all in a single workspace so you can get up and running with shared code between your server and app. The shared package is already imported by both the server & app.
