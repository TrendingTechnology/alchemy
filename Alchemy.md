# Summary
Alchemy is a swift web framework created with the developer experience in mind.
1. Easy to Learn & Understand
- Amazing Documentation.
- Excellent, in depth tutorials. On both Alchemy & Server development (primary audience will be iOS devs).
- What questions might people have and how can we ensure they know exactly where to go to answer these as soon as possible?
2. Delightful APIs
- Expressive APIs with a focus on writing safe, readable code in as few lines as possible.
- Branded APIs that are fun to write & have a natural english flow to them.
- "Swifty" APIs should have a Swift spin on them and use "cool new stuff" (but only when applicable!).
- Writing code should be fun.
- Encourage best database and SWE practices; unique identifiers on DB models, mocking & testing for DI, etc 
3. Tooling. A focus on tools to help the developer deploy, monitor & understand their server.
- The tools should be a joy to interact with. Simplicity, attractive UI, elegant CLI, etc.
- Tools that help the developer...
a) create & release faster
b) understand & monitor better
c) learn & build knowledge
- This is how we make money.

## Why Swift?
1. Elegant, powerful language. 
2. Static & an emphasis on writing safe code. Perfect for server dev.
3. A language many people are already familiar with.
4. Allows for shared code between client & server

## How does Alchemy uniquely leverage Swift to provide a web framework experience that's amazing?
1. Focus on error handling & safety. Leverage optionals, throwing and static typing.
2. Elegant APIs (functional, closures, encourage writing safe code).
3. Leverage a shared client / server language.
- How can the user write less code?
- How can the user improve type safety between client & server?
- How can the user use similar patterns on both client & server to reduce context switching?
